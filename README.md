# OBJECTIVE

To design and evaluate effective prompts using various prompt types—Comparative Analysis, Experiential Perspective, Everyday Functioning, Universal Structures, and Prompt Size Limitation—to generate insights for an AI-driven manufacturing automation system. The goal is to compare their performance across different AI models and assess their effectiveness using a rubric-based evaluation method.

# INTRODUCTION

Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in guiding AI systems to produce accurate, relevant, and meaningful responses. In the context of Industry 4.0 and smart manufacturing, AI-powered automation systems depend heavily on well-designed prompts to deliver reliable insights, generate system designs, and support decision-making.

This report makes use of a manufacturing industry scenario from Unit 5, where IoT-enabled automation is used to monitor equipment, optimize energy usage, and enable predictive maintenance. Prompts are designed based on Unit-2 prompt patterns and evaluated using a rubric-based assessment. The focus is on how different prompt types influence the quality of output across leading AI tools such as ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Copilot.

# SCENARIO 1: Comparative Analysis Prompt
Prompt Type Definition

This type asks the AI to compare and contrast two or more concepts.

Designed Prompt for Manufacturing Use Case

“Compare the effectiveness of traditional manual monitoring in manufacturing with an AI-enabled IoT monitoring system, focusing on efficiency, downtime reduction, and data accuracy.”

Purpose

To evaluate how different AI models explain differences and advantages of automation in a structured manner.

Expected Outcome

Clear comparison of features, benefits, and limitations of both approaches.

# SCENARIO 2: Experiential Perspective Prompt
Prompt Type Definition

This type asks the AI to respond from the perspective of a role or individual.

Designed Prompt for Manufacturing Use Case

“As a plant maintenance engineer, describe how predictive maintenance powered by IoT and AI has improved your workflow, reduced breakdowns, and enhanced decision-making.”

Purpose

To generate realistic, role-based insights from a first-person perspective.

Expected Outcome

Human-like, relatable explanations of how automation transforms job roles.

# SCENARIO 3: Everyday Functioning + Universal Structure + Prompt Size Limitation
1. Everyday Functioning Prompt

“Explain how automation systems in manufacturing work similarly to everyday smart devices like smart TVs or smart home appliances.”

2. Universal Prompt Structure

“Explain the process of predictive maintenance in simple terms with an example.”

3. Prompt Size Limitation Strategy

Original requirement:
“Generate a full system architecture for IoT-based automation.”

Revised prompt to fit size limitations:
“Provide the first part of the IoT-based automation system architecture, focusing only on sensors and data collection. Continue in the next step.”

Purpose

To simplify complex industrial concepts and handle lengthy outputs in manageable parts.

Expected Outcome

Gradual, clear explanations suitable for beginners or non-technical users.

# CONCLUSION

Prompt engineering significantly influences the quality, relevance, and depth of responses generated by AI tools. By applying multiple prompt structures—comparative, experiential, everyday functioning, universal, and size-limited—AI systems can produce tailored outputs suitable for different stakeholders in the manufacturing sector. This approach ensures better clarity, improved decision-making, and enhanced communication between AI systems and domain experts. Moreover, dividing complex tasks into smaller prompt chunks increases consistency and reduces errors from large output generation.

# RESULT

The experiment successfully demonstrated the use of multiple prompt types to generate meaningful and high-quality outputs for an AI-based manufacturing automation scenario. All prompt types were executed effectively, and the rubric-based evaluation confirmed that structured prompt design improves clarity, completeness, accuracy, and user relevance. The goal of analyzing prompt performance across different AI tools was achieved.
